# Vue Pixel Art Framer

I've always hated manually drawing frames around my pixel art sprites. So I made this tool to save myself some time, maybe you'll find it useful too. Try it here - https://vue-pixel-art-framer-qhljrwc2a-vrolok15s-projects.vercel.app/

## Features

- **Smart Framing**: Automatically detects sprite edges and adds frames that complement your art
- **Adjustable Frame Darkness**: Fine-tune your frame's darkness from 0% (matching the sprite's colors) to 100% (solid black)
- **Client-Side Only**: No need to upload your images anywhere, everything happens in your browser
- **Easy Export**: Save your framed sprites with a single click

## How to Use

1. Click "Load Image..." to select your pixel art sprite (PNG format only for now)
2. Adjust the frame darkness using the slider:
   - 100% for classic black outline
   - 50% for softer, half-tone frame
3. Click "Frame sprite" to add the frame
4. Click "Save" to download your framed sprite

## Perfect For

- Game developers needing consistent sprite outlines
- Pixel artists looking to enhance their artwork
- Anyone working with pixel art who wants to save time on frame creation

## Tips

- For best results, use PNG images with transparency
- Try different darkness levels to find what works best for your sprite
- Use color-matched frames for a subtle, professional look
- Use black frames (100%) for a classic retro game style
